# Smart Goal Matching System - Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clear Account Linking Match
**Transaction**: "Vacation savings for Bali" (2,000,000 IDR) from Account 129  
**Goals**:
- Liburan Ke Bali (linked to Account 129, vacation type)
- Monthly Savings (no account link, savings type) 
- Rumah (linked to Account 129, house type)

**Expected Result**: 
- Liburan Ke Bali should win (Account Link: 40 + Keywords: 30 + Context: 15 = 85 points)
- Only ONE goal gets tracked

### Scenario 2: Keyword-Based Matching
**Transaction**: "House down payment saving" (3,000,000 IDR) from unlinked account
**Goals**:
- Rumah (house type, no account link)  
- Monthly Savings (savings type, no account link)
- Emergency Fund (emergency_fund type, no account link)

**Expected Result**:
- Rumah should win (Keywords: 30 + Context: 15 + AI: 8 = 53 points)
- Only ONE goal gets tracked

### Scenario 3: AI Semantic Analysis
**Transaction**: "Investment for retirement planning" (5,000,000 IDR)
**Goals**:
- Investment Goal (investment type)
- Retirement Goal (retirement type) 
- Monthly Savings (savings type)

**Expected Result**:
- AI should help differentiate between Investment vs Retirement goals
- Higher AI semantic score should be tiebreaker
